# Ocean-modelling

This repository has no other purpose than showing what I did during my Ocean and Climate Physics Master at UBO. Some of these works rely on data that can be found online, but others work with data only available in the lab. Figures are still in the notebooks, so it shows how they have been built. 

The best figures I made are in my thesis, which is also in this folder. Unfortunately, I lost all my codes which were on the lab's data center (as I was using large dataset of the GIGATL simulation). I've only kept the modules I created to help my work (see modules_de_moi.py).
